##### Don't get stuck
*28-01-2015* Make a move as soon as you feel that the fun, the learning and the excitement of working in a particular project for a particular company is decreasing. Change team, project or company. It bad personally and professionaly to have the feeling that you are not developing, that you are stuck and bored. The more you wait, the worse it will get.

##### Take a short break when feeling negative
*28-01-2015* If you feel stressed or negative at work at a particular moment, take a break, go to a room and relax for a while. Put things in perspective. Approach the situation with a more positive view. Don't let it take control of you.

##### Transparency
*29-01-2015* I believe that full transparency from the organization and the management towards the rest of the employees is a fundamental requirement if a company wants those employees to be loyal and committed. All cases of lack of transparency that I have experienced have had the same effect on the engineers: anger, sadness, detachment and eventual resigning. As a manager, this is probably not how you want your engineers to feel.

As a manager, no matter how bad the consequences of being 100% transparent you think are, they are very likely not worse than the consequences of not being transparent.

A few examples of lack of transparency:
* if an engineer communicates to her manager that she is quitting, the manager should share these news with the rest of the team as soon as possible as it is a change that affects the whole team.
* during a stage of high voluntary turnover rate, if the management cares about the engineers quitting and is concerned about more of them doing so, the management should communicate exactly that. Example: "We care about you guys and girls, we see many of you quitting and we are very sad about that. We are going to start talking to all of you to find out what went wrong and how we can improve the situation". If you don't talk about it, engineers who have decided to stay for now will likely think that management doesn't care about them and that they simply are interchangeable parts of a machine, which leads to detachment, lack of meaning and purpose and even higher turnover.
* if management and lead architects are thinking about re-building an existing system from scratch for whatever reason, the team working with the current system should be informed from the very beginning about this idea and should be part of the discussion and decision process as they are the ones who built the system in the first place. They should also be offered to work on the new system if they want to. Needless to say, the result of failing to do these things are very negative:
  * for the engineers:
    * they will feel unmotivated, detached and lied to.
    * they will have very low productivity
    * they will eventually (rather soon) resign
  * for the company:
    * the only engineers who know about the new legacy system (a system which potentially generates a lot of money) feel as stated above.
