## Benefits of Cloud Architectures
* _Almost zero upfront infrastructure investment_: If you
have to build a large-scale system it may cost a
fortune to invest in real estate, hardware (racks,
machines, routers, backup power supplies),
hardware management (power management,
cooling), and operations personnel. Because of the
upfront costs, it would typically need several rounds
of management approvals before the project could
even get started. With utility-style computing,
there is no fixed cost or startup cost.
* _Just-in-time Infrastructure_: In the past, if you got
famous and your systems or your infrastructure did
not scale you became a victim of your own success.
Conversely, if you invested heavily and did not get
famous, you became a victim of your failure. By
deploying applications in-the-cloud with dynamic
capacity management software architects do not
have to worry about pre-procuring capacity for largescale
systems. The solutions are low risk because
you scale only as you grow. Cloud Architectures can
relinquish infrastructure as quickly as you got them
in the first place (in minutes).
* _More efficient resource utilization_: System
administrators usually worry about hardware
procuring (when they run out of capacity) and better
infrastructure utilization (when they have excess and
idle capacity). With Cloud Architectures they can
manage resources more effectively and efficiently by
having the applications request and relinquish
resources only what they need (on-demand).
* _Usage-based costing_: Utility-style pricing allows
billing the customer only for the infrastructure that
has been used.
* _Potential for shrinking the processing time_:
Parallelization is the one of the great ways to speed
up processing. Having available an elastic infrastructure
provides the application with the ability to exploit
parallelization in a cost-effective manner reducing
the total processing time.

Cloud Computing, by definition, refers to the on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
