* 28-01-2015: After a set of interviews with a particular company, no matter the type of interviews or who you met, I believe one still has a very limited amount of information as to "will I actually have fun here? will I develop in the right direction?".
Therefore I think it's better to try to spend a few days in the office of that new company before taking any decision, working with your hypothetical co-workers, seeing really the type of work they do, how they do it and maybe work on a ticket or two. After this experience, not only you will have learnt quite many new things, met new people and spent some hours in a very different way, you will also have a much better of picture of how it would be to work there. As a plus side, the company also has a much better view of it would be to have you working with them. It's a win-win.
I tried it once with a 10-employee startup and I really liked the experience. Don't know how it would work with a much bigger company though.
* 28-01-2015: When looking for a job, try to find several companies that you might be interested in joining and apply for them. After a first interview, choose three of them and go forward with them for as long as possible. It is benefitial to have multiple alternatives. Companies also have multiple candidates, so you should have a few company candidates as well. Not only companies analyse you, you also analyse the companies and compare them with the other alternatives. It is a healthy thing to do.
