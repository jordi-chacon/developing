##### Think before speaking
*28-01-2015* I have always admired people who think before they speak, who speak slowly and who take pauses to think again. Usually these people's words are more meaningful. They speak less, with higher quality. I would like to work towards this.

##### Verify by yourself that an issue exists before fixing it
*28-01-2015* When someone (a developer, a product owner, any stakeholder) tells you that there is a very important issue in the system, always verify that this is the case before starting to write a fix for it. The information they got might be wrong or might have been misunderstood / miscommunicated.
